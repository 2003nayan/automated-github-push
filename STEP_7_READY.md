## 🚀 How to Run Integration Tests

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. **Update tokens in the run script:**
   ```bash
   nano run_integration_test.sh
   ```

   Replace with your actual tokens:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN_NK="ghp_sje..." # Your full token
   export GITHUB_TOKEN_AI4M="ghp_Whp..." # Your full token
   ```

2. **Run the test:**
   ```bash
   ./run_integration_test.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Confirm repository creation when asked
   - Manually verify on GitHub (URLs will be shown)

## 📊 What Will Happen

The integration test will:

1. ✓ Verify all 36 unit tests still pass
2. ✓ Load and verify configuration
3. ✓ Test GitHub authentication for both accounts
4. ✓ Ask permission to create repositories
5. ✓ Process test projects and push to GitHub
6. ✓ Verify state file is correct
7. ✓ Test all CLI commands
8. ✓ Show summary and next steps

## ⏱️ Expected Duration

- **Test execution:** ~2-3 minutes
- **Manual verification:** ~2 minutes
- **Total:** ~5 minutes

## 🎯 Success Indicators

After running, you should see:

✅ All unit tests passed (36/36)
✅ Configuration loaded correctly
✅ Both accounts authenticated
✅ 2 repositories created on GitHub
✅ State file updated
✅ CLI commands working

## 🔍 Manual Verification Required

After the script completes, verify on GitHub:

1. **Visit https://github.com/2003nayan**
   - Should see: `test-backup-nk` repository
   - Check: Commits by 2003nayan

2. **Visit https://github.com/nayan-ai4m**
   - Should see: `test-backup-ai4m` repository
   - Check: Commits by nayan-ai4m
